# superconductingVortex
# calculates magnetic field of a magnetic vortex at a certain height
# then convolves with a SQUID pickup loop
# default penetration depth is set at 500um so a Pearl vortex
# but can be easily adapeted for a bulk Abrikosov vortex
# function getVortex is adapted from a matlab code by John R. Kirtley
# PhysRevLett.92.157006 shows why the exacte Fourier term is chosen as well as show experimental vortex images
