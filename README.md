# superconductingVortex
# calculates the magnetic field of a magnetic vortex at a certain height
# then convolves with a SQUID pickup loop
# default penetration depth is set at 500um, so a Pearl vortex
# but can be easily adapted for a bulk Abrikosov vortex
# function getVortex is adapted from a Matlab code by John R. Kirtley
# PhysRevLett.92.157006 shows why the exact Fourier term is chosen as well as shows experimental vortex images
